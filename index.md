I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
I am advised by [Gal Mishne](http://mishne.ucsd.edu/).
My research covers a broad range of machine learning/computer vision problems, sometimes their application in neuroscience.
I am particularly interested in generative models, from traditional statistical modeling to deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and diffusion models (DMs).
Currently I am working on the intersection of probablistic graphical modeling and graph signal processing.
Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Biomedical Engineering from Beihang University (former BUAA).
I also interned at [NEC Lab America](https://www.nec-labs.com/).
