I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), advised by [Gal Mishne](http://mishne.ucsd.edu/).
I am broadly interested in assorted machine learning problems, with a focus on generative models of various types of data.
Currently I am working on the intersection of probablistic graphical modeling and graph signal processing.
Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Biomedical Engineering from Beihang University (former BUAA).
I also interned at [NEC Lab America](https://www.nec-labs.com/).
